# Phase 2: Programming, Git, and Prompt Engineering

Author: [GPS](https://twitter.com/madebygps)

## How does this phase apply to Cloud?

You'll be using code to automate tasks, deploy infrastructure, and work with services. You don't need to know how to build UIs but you need to know how to work with APIs. Plus, knowing how to program will make you more competitive in the hiring market. In the previous step you were introduced to programming basics and wrote your first Bash script. You can now leverage this knowledge and apply it to your choice of programming language.

## What You Need To Learn

There are several programming languages that are popular with Cloud: Go, Rust, .NET, JavaScript. If you know any of these, you can continue using them, if not, since you are a beginner,  I would go with [Python](https://www.python.org/). It's a very popular language and there are many quality free resources out there to learn it.

Along side learning to code, you'll need leverage [Git](https://git-scm.com/). It's the most popular version control tool and one of the DevOps practices. It is used to manage and share your code. GitHub is one of the most popular repository hosting service. 

Take some time now to create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account if you don't already have one. It'll be your code portfolio and this is how you showcase projects on your resume. 

We also recommend you at this point leverage tools like GitHub Copilot and Prompt Engineering to help you write code more productively.

## How to break down this phase

I would suggest spending time on these two topics and this timeline:

| Order | Topic                           |
|-------|---------------------------------|
| 1 | Learn to Code |
| 2 | Learn Git and GitHub |
| 3 | Learn Prompt Engineering |
